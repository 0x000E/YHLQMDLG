# YHLQMDLG

YHLQMDLG is a **WIP** League of Legends summoner name turbo/sniper tool.

There are two modes to YHLQMDLG:

1. **Turbo**: Will attempt to change your summoner name to the requested one 24/7 until successful.
2. **Sniper**: Will attempt to change your summoner name to the requested one on the expiration date.
To see when a name expires check out [lolnames.gg](https://lolnames.gg/en/).

Please note this is a **WIP** and updates will happen to improve YHLQMDLG. As of now *(14/08/2020)*
the `Turbo` mode is essentially fully functional, while the `Sniper` mode has yet to be completed.

If you have questions or concerns please feel free to contact me here or on **Discord @icantcode#5581**.
